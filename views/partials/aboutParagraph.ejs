<h3>Hi!</h3>
<h2>My name is Shane.</h2>
<h1>I fix things and solve problems.</h1>
<br/>
<p>
    I can currently be found in San Diego, CA optimizing and supporting the industry leading <a href='https://www.certona.com/' target='#'>Certona</a> 
    personalization recommendation engine for <a href="https://kibocommerce.com/" target='#'>Kibo Commerce</a>.<br/><br/>
    In my free time I like going for long walks with my pandemic puppy, 
    watching (and probably being very frustrated with) the Boston Red Sox, 
    working on a new uDemy course or hacking away on a problem from Project Euler. 
    When it's time to really unplug and hit the reset button I love traveling the world with my girlfriend. 
    Copenhagen, Denmark is my favorite city on Earth not named San Diego.
