<h3>Hi.</h3><br/>
<h2>My name is Shane.</h2><br/>
<h1>I fix things and solve problems.</h1><br/>
<br/>
<p>
    I can currently be found in San Diego, CA leading the newly created Implementaion and Partner Engineering Team
    for <a href="https://kibocommerce.com/" target='#'>Kibo Commerce</a>.<br/><br/>
    In my free time I love going for long walks with my dog, 
    watching baseball (specifically the the Boston Red Sox & San Diego Padres), 
    working on a new uDemy course, hacking away on a problem from <a href='https://projecteuler.net/' target='#'>Project Euler</a>, or reading about history. 
    When it's time to really unplug and hit the reset button I love traveling the world. 
    Copenhagen, Denmark is my favorite city on Earth outside of San Diego.
